    <h1>Homework 6: Census Data Chloropleth</h1>
    <h2>Bladen Currier</h2>
    <h1>Homework 6.1</h1>
    <h2>This Chloropleth represents Education in Georgia counties. More specifically, the legend shows how the map is color coded based on the numbers of people enrolled in school for each county (above the age of 3). You can easily see that a cluster of counties in north Georgia have a higher number of people enrolled in school.  </h2>

   <h1>Homework 6.2</h1>
   <h2>Ratio: Percentage of Each County's Population Enrolled in School in Georgia</h2>
<h2>Equal Count Mode</h2>
<h3>Description: Equal Count mode seperates the data evenly across 5 categories. This is positive because it creates five categories with the same number of counties. This is mostly negative though because the categories do not accuratley represent the data. For example, the last category has a range of 12%, while the middle category has a range of 1%. A county with 26% population enrolled in school should not be grouped into the same category as a county with 38% of its population enrolled. </h3>

<h2>Equal Interval Mode</h2>
<h3>Description: Equal Interval mode allows us to see consistent intervals in the data. This could be considered a positive because it assigns a category to each county, and each county must fit into 1 of 5 categories. The negative aspect of this is that similiar data may be put into different catergories simply because it is off by a minor decimal place. For example, most of the data in the ligh green category (16.4-21.8) is less than 2% different than the next catergory (medium green, 21.8-27.2%) </h3>

<h2>Natural Breaks Mode</h2>
<h3>Description: The Natural Breaks mode allows us to see where the data is concentrated. The middle green color (22-25%) holds most of the data. The catergory directly above and below hold the next biggest amount of data. The top and bottom categories hold the least amount of data. The positive of using this mode is that we can see that most counties have between 22-25% of people enrolled in school. The negative side of this mode is that the categroies at polar ends are quite large, while the categories in the middle are smaller. The intervals in each catergory are not consistent</h3>
