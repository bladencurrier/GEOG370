    <h1>Homework 6: Census Data Chloropleth</h1>
    <h1>Bladen Currier</h1>
    <h2>This Chloropleth represents Education in Georgia counties. More specifically, the legend shows how the map is color coded based on the numbers of people enrolled in school for each county (above the age of 3). You can easily see that a cluster of counties in north Georgia have a higher number of their population enrolled in school.  </h2>
