    <h1>Homework 8</h1>
    <h1>Are all Chapel Hill parks within a 1 mile walking distance of either Chapel Hill Transit Bus Stops or GoTriangle Bus Stops?</h1>
<h3> Transportation accessibility and physical health and wellbeing are both important topics to me. So, I was curious about the accessibility of parks in Chapel Hill. Public Transportation is one way that most people can use to access parks. One mile is about the maximum distance a person would walk to get to their destination, so I created a 1 mile buffer around both Chapel Hill Transit and GoTriangle Bus Stops. I used the buffer tool to create the initial buffers, and then I used the union tool to merge the buffers. Lastly, I used the dissolve tool to get rid of any overlapping boundary lines to make the picture clearer. I found that all parks in Chapel Hill are within a reasonable walking distance from at least one bus stop.  </h3>
